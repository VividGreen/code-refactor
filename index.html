Above the cloud is a drawn, yellow, diamond shape with a think red border. Inside the diamond shape is text that reads: POPULAR in a greyish blue font color.

The first image moving clockwise from the diamond is a representation of html headings. Just below a bolded text that reads: HEADINGS, there is the text: H1 in a blue color. Just below the H1, there is the text: H2 in a smaller, red font. Just below the H2 there is the text: H3, in an even smaller, green font.

The next image is titled LINK BUILDING which is a drawn picture of a suspension bridge over a river. The last image is titled BACKLINK, which is a drawn picture of two chain sections, linked together.

            <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>
            <p>
                The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.
